		<h1>Medical Power of Attorney Form</h1>
			
				<p>By signing this document, you are giving authority to the person you are designating as your agent to make medical decisions on your behalf. Medical decisions can include any medical service, treatment, medical procedure, diagnosis or treat both mental and physical conditions. Your agent will be able to act with the same authority you would have if you were able to act for yourself and will have the authority to consent, refuse to consent to medical treatment including decisions about withdrawing or withholding life- sustaining treatment. It is, therefore, important that you know and trust your agent and that your agent is aware of your preferences for health care treatment.</p>	
				<p>Even after you sign this document, you will still be able to make your health care decisions assuming you are still considered mentally competent. Your agent cannot act on your behalf until your physician has determined that you are no longer physically or mentally able to make medical decisions.</p>
				<p>The person you choose as your agent must be at least eighteen years old and someone that you trust with your health care. Your agent is not liable for any decisions they make on your behalf, as long as those decisions were made in good faith. You should make sure that you have chosen agent wants to take on the role as agent. Discuss your medical preferences with your agent so they are aware of your wishes. Review this document with your agent so they are aware of their role. You also may choose a back- up agent in case your other agent is unavailable to act. Your back-up agent should also be over 18 and aware of your preferences.</p>
				<p>You may revoke this document at any time while you are still competent to do so. You may revoke it by telling your medical provider and your agent that you are revoking the document or you may provide them a written revocation. If you execute another power of attorney later, that will have the effect of revoking this one.</p>
